# labrad_tools.sr1


To setup a git, first clone to working computer (if first time)
git clone https://github.com/sronelab/labrad_tools.sr1.git

We then need to add altered files to the staging area (to prepare to push)
Either:
    git add example_file
    git add -all

We then need to commit by either
    git commit -m "message for commit"
    git commit

Finally, push the changes to master
    git commit
